Tree is a graph which is connected and has no cycle

A spanning tree is a tree which contains all the vertices when a graph is given.

For a given graph we can have multiple spanning trees

For a spanning tree:
V=n
E=n-1

What are MST?
It is a weighted graph ka spanning tree

MST= Weighted, Connected and Undirected
We have included the edges only having the minimum weight

Kruskals Algorithm
THis algorithm helps in caculating the MST of a given graph. 
a counter will maintain the number of edges it has picked.
