There are n piles of stones. Each pile of stone has a height Ai. Mickey and Minnie are bored, so they decide to play a game. The game is as follows -

Minnie will give Mickey an integer k. Now Mickey has to make the difference between the height of the highest pile and the lowest equal to k.

In a move, Mickey can either increase the height of any pile by one or decrease by one.

Find the minimum number of moves Mickey will need.

Note: Answers can be large use long long.
Input Format

The first line of input consists of a single integer t (1≤t≤1000), the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1≤n≤10^5) (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^9), number of piles and value of k respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n space separated integers (1≤Ai≤10^9), the height of the ith pile.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
Output Format

For each test case, print the minimum number of moves required to do the task.
